This is a backend project.

Notes:-

In Express.js, middleware refers to functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle. Middleware functions can perform various tasks such as:

Executing code.
Modifying request and response objects.
Terminating the request-response cycle.
Calling the next middleware function in the stack.
Middleware functions are crucial in Express.js for tasks like request processing, authentication, logging, error handling, etc. They are added to the application's request-response pipeline using the app.use() method or specific HTTP verb methods like app.get(), app.post(), etc.

example:

const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Middleware function
app.use(function(req, res, next) {
  console.log('A request was made to the server.');
  next(); // Calling next() passes control to the next middleware function
});

// Route handler
app.get('/', function(req, res) {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(3000, function() {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});

In this example, the middleware function logs a message whenever a request is made to the server before passing control to the route handler. Middleware functions can be chained together, and the order in which they are defined determines the order in which they are executed in the request-response cycle.


if we write app.get('/users', function(req, res) {}), means we are not exporting the routes. but when we export the routes and import them for handling routes, then, in this case, we need to use the middleware.
So, we write app.use('/users', userRouter);
So, when someone will write /users, then, it will give control to the userRouter.

we can extract json data from req.body.
